CS 255 Portfolio Submission - DriverPass Project
Summary

The DriverPass project was about making a system for a driving school. DriverPass needed something that let students schedule lessons, take practice tests, and keep track of their progress online. They wanted it to work on both computers and phones, and it needed to be easy for students, instructors, and admins to use.
What I Did Well

I think I did a good job breaking down what the client wanted and putting it into clear requirements and designs. I made sure everything was easy to follow and lined up with what DriverPass asked for.
What I Would Revise

If I could change anything, I would go back and make the UML diagrams better. I would add more detail and show more of the choices a user might make when using the system.
How I Met User Needs

I spent a lot of time going over the interview and making sure I didn’t miss anything important. I built the features around what DriverPass needed, like lesson booking, practice tests, and admin controls. It’s important to focus on user needs because if the system doesn’t work the way they expect, they won’t want to use it.
My Approach to Software Design

When I design software, I try to keep it simple and think about what the user actually needs. In the future, I’ll probably use more user stories and simple sketches before getting into full diagrams, just to make sure the system makes sense from the start.
